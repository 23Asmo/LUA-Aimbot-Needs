Name	Value	Summary
Linear	0	
Moves at a constant speed.
Sine	1	
Speed is determined by a sine wave.

Back	2	
Slightly overshoots the target, then backs into place.

Quad	3	
Speed is determined by quadratic interpolation.

Quart	4	
Similar to Quad, but starts at a higher speed determined by quartic interpolation.

Quint	5	
Similar to Quart, but starts at a higher speed determined by quintic interpolation.

Bounce	6	
Bounces backwards multiple times after reaching the target, before eventually settling.

Elastic	7	
Moves as if attached to a rubber band, overshooting the target several times.

Exponential	8	
Speed reduces very quickly as tween approaches the target.

Circular	9	
Follows a circular arc, slowing down as tween approaches the target.

Cubic	10	
Similar to Quad, but starts at a lower speed.
